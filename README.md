# Developer Relations Extras

This repo contains supporting artifacts for Modular blogs, videos, and
workshops. Each subfolder is prefixed by date in `YYMM` format so you can view our
most recently released content, and contains a README.md with a link to the
content.

Please note that, each example includes an identifier for which release of MAX
or Mojo it has been tested with. While we will make the best effort to keep
these examples up to date, older code may not work perfectly with newer
versions. To help us keep our focus on ongoing development of MAX, we make a
best effort to accept and review PRs but maybe not be able to address all
issues. We encourage you to consult the MAX and Mojo repositories for the latest
documentation and maintained examples
